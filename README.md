### Sonic Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This is a recreation of the game tic-tac-toe in a web browser. It's set up so that each click the user makes in a square will place an Sonic in that spot and then have the computer randomly pick a spot to place an Eggman. If either you or the computer wins, a line is drawn, it plays a victory sound clip, and the next round begins automatically, starting with the next player's turn. There is also a tie sound clip.
### Calculator
This is a basic calculator that users can operate to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division calucations on a web browser.
### Pizza Menu
This project is a menu used to order pizza by chosing the size and toppings. It uses JavaScript code to take those various inputs and calculate a price based on the radio and checkboxes selected, providing the final price for the order.
